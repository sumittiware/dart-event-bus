# Event Bus

A simple Event Bus using Dart [Streams](https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/stable/dartdoc-viewer/dart:async.Stream)
for decoupling applications.

## Event Bus Pattern

An Event Bus follows the publish/subscribe pattern. It allows listeners to
subscribe for events and publishers to fire events. This enables objects to
interact without requiring to explicitly define listeners and keeping track of
them.

### Event Bus and MVC

The Event Bus pattern is especially helpful for decoupling [MVC](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_Controller)
(or [MVP](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_Presenter)) applications.

**One group of MVC** is not a problem.

![Model-View-Controller](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcojakob/dart-event-bus/master/doc/mvc.png)

But as soon as there are **multiple groups of MVCs**, those groups will have to talk
to each other. This creates a tight coupling between the controllers.

By communication through an **Event Bus**, the coupling is reduced.

## Usage

### 1. Create an Event Bus

Create an instance of `EventBus` and make it available to other classes.

Usually there is just one Event Bus per application, but more than one may be
set up to group a specific set of events.

```dart
import 'package:event_bus/event_bus.dart';

EventBus eventBus = EventBus();
```

**Note:** _The default constructor will create an asynchronous event bus. To
create a synchronous bus you must provide the optional `sync: true` attribute._

### 2. Define Events

Any Dart class can be used as an event.

```dart
class UserLoggedInEvent {
  User user;

  UserLoggedInEvent(this.user);
}

class NewOrderEvent {
  Order order;

  NewOrderEvent(this.order);
}
```

### 3. Register Listeners

Register listeners for **specific events**:

```dart
eventBus.on<UserLoggedInEvent>().listen((event) {
  // All events are of type UserLoggedInEvent (or subtypes of it).
  print(event.user);
});
```

Register listeners for **all events**:

```dart
eventBus.on().listen((event) {
  // Print the runtime type. Such a set up could be used for logging.
  print(event.runtimeType);
});
```

#### About Dart Streams

`EventBus` uses Dart [Streams](https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/stable/dartdoc-viewer/dart:async.Stream)
as its underlying mechanism to keep track of listeners. You may use all
functionality available by the [Stream](https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/stable/dartdoc-viewer/dart:async.Stream)
API. One example is the use of [StreamSubscriptions](https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/stable/dartdoc-viewer/dart:async.StreamSubscription)
to later unsubscribe from the events.

```dart
StreamSubscription loginSubscription = eventBus.on<UserLoggedInEvent>().listen((event) {
  print(event.user);
});

loginSubscription.cancel();
```

### 4. Fire Events

Finally, we need to fire an event.

```dart
User myUser = User('Mickey');
eventBus.fire(UserLoggedInEvent(myUser));
```

## Using Custom Stream Controllers

Instead of using the default `StreamController` you can use the following constructor
to provide your own.

An example would be to use an [RxDart](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart) Subject
as the controller.

```dart
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

EventBus behaviorBus = EventBus.customController(BehaviorSubject());
```
